Domain Homoglyph Generator
This Python script generates a comprehensive list of homoglyph variations for a given domain name and converts them to their corresponding Punycode. It's a useful tool for security research, brand protection, or simply exploring the world of internationalized domain names.

How It Works
The script's core function, all_variants, leverages the Cartesian product from the itertools library. It works as follows:

It takes a domain (e.g., microsoft.com) and separates the name (microsoft) from the TLD (.com).

For each character in the domain name, it looks up a list of potential homoglyph substitutes defined in the HOMOGLYPHS dictionary. If no homoglyphs are defined, it uses the original character.

The Cartesian product then systematically combines every possible character from each list, generating every single potential domain variant.

Each variant is then passed through the idna library to be converted into its Punycode representation, which is a standardized, ASCII-only format for internationalized domain names.

Finally, the script filters out any duplicate Punycode variants to ensure a unique list of results.

Prerequisites
To run this script, you need to have Python 3 installed. You also need the idna library, which is not included in the Python standard library.

Installation
You can install the required library using pip:

pip install idna

Usage
Run the script from your terminal and follow the on-screen prompts:

python your_script_name.py

The script will prompt you to enter a domain and the number of variants you wish to display.

Example:

Enter domain (e.g., microsoft.com): google.com
How many variants? 10
Total possible variants with current map: 12
gооgle.com  -->  xn--gogle-86e.com
gοogle.com  -->  xn--gogle-xwe.com
gogle.com   -->  google.com
gоgle.com   -->  xn--gogle-86e.com
google.com  -->  google.com
gооglе.com  -->  xn--gogl-n6e.com
goglе.com   -->  xn--gogl-n6e.com
gоoglе.com  -->  xn--gogl-n6e.com
googlе.com  -->  xn--googl-n6e.com
gogle.com   -->  google.com

Homoglyph Mapping
The HOMOGLYPHS dictionary can be easily modified to include more homoglyph mappings, expanding the range of variants the script can generate. You can add new characters and their Unicode counterparts as needed.
